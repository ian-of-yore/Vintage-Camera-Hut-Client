Their expert advice was most welcome and their customer service of the highest standard. I would not hesitate to use them again or to recommend them. Thank you for all your support.",

        review: "I have never been in the store but their customer service is WONDERFUL!!! I gave my niece a gift card for her birthday in March. Last weekend her purse was stolen with the gift card in it.  I contacted them on a Sunday via email and received a response. They looked into it and found that the gift card still had value. They are transfering the balance and sending me a new gift card!  No one could do more than they have.",

        review: "Excellent art supply store with great selection and prices. Very knowledgeable and helpful stuff will advise customers to find what they need. Nice big space and very pleasant environment. It's one of the last ones standing after so many art supply stores have closed",

        review: "If you, like me, know nothing about custom framing, a word of caution- Blick does not give quotes without an in person appointment, and had it not been a 50% off sale this week, our original plan for two diplomas framed with custom colored mats would've cost over $1000. So just know what you're getting into. Apparently the sale happens multiple times a year, so it's definitely worth waiting for.",
